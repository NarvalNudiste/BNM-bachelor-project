## Bachelor project 2018

### Abstract

*This school project, in collaboration with Bienne's Nouveau Mus√©e, aims to develop a small educational VR activity oriented towards childrens and young visitors.
As the exhibition will feature original work from an invited painter representing a palaeolithic life scene, visitors will be able to inspect and interact with virtual objects from this era which would be way too fragile to manipulate in real life.
The intent is to educate players on said objects with an entertaining experience.*
