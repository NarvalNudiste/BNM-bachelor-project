## Bachelor project 2018

### Abstract

*This school project, in collaboration with Bienne's Nouveau Mus√©e, aims to develop a small educational serious game in virtual reality oriented towards childrens and young visitors.
As the exhibition will feature original work from an invited painter representing a palaeolithic life scene, visitors will be able to interact with a virtual representation of objects from this era which would be way too fragile to manipulate in real life and replace them in a painting.
The intent is to educate players on said objects with an entertaining experience.*
