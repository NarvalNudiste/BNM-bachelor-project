## Context

Bienne's Nouveau Musée was born from the merger of Musée Schwab and Musée Neuhaus in 2012.
Focused towards archeology, history and art, the museum regularly holds temporary exhibitions. One of those exhibitions, which will take place around june 2018, will feature works of an invited painter and will be themed around perception.

The NMB asked the HE-Arc (Haute-Ecole Arc) to provide the exhibition with an virtual reality installation aimed towards young visitors to explore virtual reality potential in exhibitions.

## Goal

Develop a small educational serious game in virtual reality.
As the exhibition will feature original work from an invited painter representing a palaeolithic life scene, visitors will be able to interact with a virtual representation of objects from this era which would be way too fragile to manipulate in real life and replace them in a painting.
The intent is to educate players on said objects with an entertaining experience

The players are set in a replica of Bienne's Nouveau Musée. They are presented with a table on top of which 5 distinct palaeolithic objects are laying. In front of them is a large painting picturing the use of said objects in a real life scenario.
The objective of the game is to match each object by replacing them in the correct area of the picture. By doing so, objects will "fade" into the picture, reveiling the original work of art.
Objects will be accompagnied by a short description (maybe sound) provided by the Museum.

## Environment

The Unity game engine will be used, along scripts written in C#. The VR device will be an HTC Vive. 3D models (Room, small props) will be created in Maxon Cinema 4D. As of sound, possible editing will be done in Ableton Live.

## Objectives

### Primary

* Unity implementation
* Movement in a restricted area
* Objects interactions
* Matching mechanic
* 3D model of the room (realistic type of render)
* UI (Text overlay)
* Sound (if provided by the client)
* Reset mechanic
* Installation

### Seconday

* Feedback effects
* UI better integration
* Object breaking / Respawning
